## About The Project

This project focuses on constructing a scalable, full stack application using using .NET and C#. This project specifically is a Learning Management System (LMS) similar to Canvas built utilizing Microsoft Visual Studio. The project begins with the basics of C# as a programming language, and then quickly moves on to advanced topics including the construction of GUIs, web services, and database-driven applications. A core goal of the project is to gain foundational knowledge in how full stack development takes place amidst routine software evolution and maintenance. In so doing, experience is gained on identifying and remediating architectural debt while being introduced to common coding and design patterns.

## Project Objectives
This project demonstrates:
* Debugging, troubleshooting, and resolving bugs in .NET applications.
* Creation of a moderately sized .NET application.
* Contributing meaningfully to the development of an existing .NET application using frameworks such as Windows Presentation Foundation, Universal Windows Platform, Xamarin.Forms, WebAPI, and Entity Framework.
* Constructing client-server applications using industry best practices for differentiating client- and server- side code while optimizing scalability and minimizing system latency.
* Identifying architectural/technical debt and plan and execute a refactoring exercise to mitigate that debt using common design patterns.

## Roadmap

- [x] Construct a Console Application Based on a List of Functional Requirements.
- [x] Improve the existing Console Application by Including Additional Features.
- [x] Convert the Console Application Into a Xamarin.Forms Mobile Application with a Custom User Interface.
- [ ] Create a RESTful Web Service to Support the Application.
- [ ] Add a Database Persistence Component to the Client-Server Application .
